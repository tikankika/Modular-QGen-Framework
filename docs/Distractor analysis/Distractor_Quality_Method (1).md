# DISTRACTOR QUALITY METHOD
## Systematic Framework for Plausible Multiple-Choice Distractors

**Problem Identified:**
1. Distractors not plausible enough (too easy to eliminate)
2. Length inconsistency (correct answer often longest)
3. Language quality issues

---

## THE SYSTEMATIC METHOD

### STEP 1: IDENTIFY DISTRACTOR SOURCES (Priority Order)

**TIER 1: DOCUMENTED MISCONCEPTIONS** ⭐⭐⭐
- Best source: actual student errors from teaching experience
- From BB1 Stage 0: 6 documented misconceptions
- Students who hold these beliefs will genuinely be torn
- **Example:** "Biofuels are carbon neutral" → distractor claiming zero net emissions

**TIER 2: PARTIAL TRUTHS & INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING** ⭐⭐
- Statement that is true in some context but wrong here
- Correct about one aspect but misses critical distinction
- **Example:** "Biogenic CO₂ is part of carbon cycle" (true) → "so doesn't contribute to climate change" (wrong conclusion)

**TIER 3: CONFUSION WITH RELATED CONCEPTS** ⭐⭐
- Mix up closely related but distinct concepts
- Attribute properties of concept A to concept B
- **Example:** Confusing WTT with TTW, DLUC with ILUC, 1st gen with 2nd gen biofuels

**TIER 4: OVERGENERALIZATION / UNDERGENERALIZATION** ⭐
- Correct principle applied too broadly or too narrowly
- Using absolute terms where nuance is needed
- **Example:** "Never" when it's "rarely", "Always" when it's "usually"

**AVOID (Never use):**
- Absurd/obviously wrong options ("weighs less", "is poisonous")
- Grammatically distinct options
- Answers that can be eliminated by test-taking strategies
- Technical impossibilities that any student would recognize

---

### STEP 2: ENSURE LENGTH CONSISTENCY

**Word Count Rule:**
- Count words in each option
- Median length ± 2 words for all options
- Correct answer should NOT be longest (gives clue)

**Structure Parallelism:**
- All options start the same way (verb, noun phrase, etc.)
- Same grammatical structure throughout
- Same level of specificity

**Example - BEFORE (length problem):**
```
A) It weighs less (3 words) ❌
B) Biogenic CO₂ comes from carbon that was recently absorbed by plants through photosynthesis, while fossil CO₂ releases carbon that has been locked away for millions of years (28 words) ✓ [TOO LONG - obvious answer]
C) It's more toxic (3 words) ❌
D) It doesn't contribute (3 words) ❌
```

**Example - AFTER (length balanced):**
```
A) Biogenic CO₂ participates in the short-term carbon cycle, while fossil CO₂ adds carbon that was geologically sequestered (17 words) ✓
B) Biogenic CO₂ produces less heat per unit mass than fossil CO₂ during combustion (14 words) ❌
C) Biogenic CO₂ is chemically identical but comes from renewable sources that reabsorb carbon (13 words) ❌ [partial truth]
D) Biogenic CO₂ cycling is carbon-neutral over crop rotation periods, unlike fossil emissions (12 words) ❌ [misconception]
```

---

### STEP 3: LANGUAGE QUALITY CONTROL

**Parallel Construction:**
- Begin all options with same grammatical element
- Maintain consistent verb tense
- Use same level of formality

**Technical Precision:**
- Use correct terminology consistently
- Avoid vague language ("stuff", "things")
- Match discipline-specific language level

**Clarity:**
- Each distractor should be clear and unambiguous
- Student should understand what the option claims
- No trick language or double negatives

## SYSTEMATIC DISTRACTOR CREATION PROCESS

### For Each Question:

**Phase 1: Mine Content Sources**
1. Check BB1 Stage 0 for documented misconceptions
2. Review lecture transcripts for common confusions
3. Consider typical student errors at this level

**Phase 2: Generate Candidate Distractors**
1. Create 6-8 potential distractors using TIER system
2. Prioritize Tier 1 & 2 sources
3. Ensure variety in error types

**Phase 3: Apply Filters**
1. **Plausibility test:** Would a student who studied but misunderstood choose this?
2. **Length check:** Count words, ensure ±2 from median
3. **Structure check:** Parallel grammatical construction?
4. **Expertise check:** Requires understanding to eliminate (not just test strategy)?

**Phase 4: Refinement**
1. Adjust language for consistency
2. Balance specificity across all options
3. Ensure no "giveaway" cues (absolute terms, length, etc.)

## EXAMPLE APPLICATION: Q2 Biogenic vs Fossil CO₂

### ORIGINAL (Poor Quality):
```
A) Biogent CO₂ väger mindre än fossilt CO₂ [3 words, absurd]
B) Biogent CO₂ kommer från koldioxid som nyligen tagits upp av växter via fotosyntes, medan fossilt CO₂ frigör kol som varit bundet i miljontals år [28 words, correct - TOO LONG]
C) Biogent CO₂ är mer giftigt än fossilt CO₂ [7 words, absurd]
D) Biogent CO₂ bidrar inte till växthuseffekten, medan fossilt CO₂ gör det [12 words, misconception but poorly worded]
```

**Problems:**
- Length: 3, 28, 7, 12 words → correct answer obvious
- Plausibility: A and C are absurd (chemically identical molecule)
- Language: Inconsistent structure

---

### REVISION PROCESS:

**Step 1: Mine Sources**
- Misconception from BB1: "Biofuels are carbon neutral"
- Common confusion: Short-term vs long-term carbon cycle
- Partial truth: "Both are CO₂" (chemically identical)
- Related concept: Net vs gross emissions

**Step 2: Generate Candidates (Tier 1 & 2)**
1. "Biogenic CO₂ is part of short-term carbon cycle; fossil CO₂ adds new carbon from geological storage" ✓ (Tier 1 - correct)
2. "Biogenic CO₂ has same warming potential during atmospheric residence, but source determines net climate impact" (Tier 2 - partial truth, bit complex)
3. "Biogenic CO₂ originates from recently living biomass; fossil CO₂ from ancient organic matter" (Tier 1 - correct but less precise)
4. "Biogenic CO₂ is reabsorbed by new plant growth, making it carbon-neutral over time" (Tier 1 - MISCONCEPTION)
5. "Both are chemically identical; the distinction relates to carbon accounting rules, not molecular properties" (Tier 2 - partial truth)
6. "Biogenic CO₂ comes from sustainable sources; fossil CO₂ from non-renewable sources" (Tier 3 - confusion about sustainability vs carbon cycle)

**Step 3: Select Best 4 & Balance Length**

Target length: ~15-18 words per option

**A) ✓ CORRECT**
"Biogenic CO₂ originates from recently photosynthesized carbon; fossil CO₂ releases carbon sequestered for millions of years" (15 words)

**B) ❌ MISCONCEPTION (Tier 1)**
"Biogenic CO₂ is reabsorbed by new crops, making it carbon-neutral; fossil CO₂ adds net emissions" (15 words)
[Common misconception: ignores ILUC, processing emissions, time lag]

**C) ❌ PARTIAL TRUTH (Tier 2)**
"Both are chemically identical CO₂; the key difference lies in carbon accounting methodologies and regulations" (15 words)
[Technically true but misses the FUNDAMENTAL difference in carbon cycle timescale]

**D) ❌ CONFUSION (Tier 3)**
"Biogenic CO₂ comes from renewable resources; fossil CO₂ from non-renewable sources affecting long-term reserves" (14 words)
[Confuses renewable/non-renewable (resource sustainability) with carbon cycle dynamics]

**Step 4: Final Polish for Parallelism**

All options now:
- Start with subject (Biogenic CO₂ / Both / etc.)
- Similar length (14-15 words)
- Same technical level
- Semicolon structure for contrast where appropriate

### FINAL HIGH-QUALITY VERSION:

**Q2: Biogenic vs Fossil CO₂ (REVISED)**

**Question Stem:**
What is the fundamental difference between biogenic CO₂ and fossil CO₂?

**Answer Choices:**

**A) ✓** Biogenic CO₂ originates from recently photosynthesized carbon; fossil CO₂ releases carbon sequestered for millions of years (15 words)

**B)** Biogenic CO₂ is reabsorbed by new crops, making it carbon-neutral; fossil CO₂ adds net emissions (15 words)

**C)** Both are chemically identical CO₂; the difference lies in carbon accounting methodologies and regulatory frameworks (15 words)

**D)** Biogenic CO₂ comes from renewable resources; fossil CO₂ depletes non-renewable reserves affecting sustainability (13 words)

**Correct Answer:** A

**Feedback:**

**Correct (A):** The fundamental difference is **temporal scale of the carbon cycle**. Biogenic CO₂ comes from carbon that was recently (years to decades) absorbed from the atmosphere by plants. Fossil CO₂ releases carbon that was removed from the atmosphere millions of years ago, representing a NET addition to current atmospheric carbon.

**Why B is wrong (common misconception):** While biogenic CO₂ CAN be reabsorbed, this doesn't automatically make it "carbon neutral." Land use changes (ILUC), processing emissions, and temporal lag between emission and reabsorption mean biofuels can still contribute net positive emissions.

**Why C is wrong (partial truth):** Yes, they're chemically identical (same molecule), but this misses the point. The distinction isn't just "accounting" - it's about whether carbon is cycling on human timescales (biogenic) or adding geologically-stored carbon to the active cycle (fossil).

**Why D is wrong (confusion):** This confuses resource renewability (sustainability of feedstock supply) with carbon cycle dynamics (atmospheric impact). A resource can be renewable but still contribute net carbon emissions.
