# COSEAQ 2.0: Process Metaperspective Framework
## Understanding What Happens in Each Phase

---

## THE FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION

### From Static to Dialogic
**Static (Traditional):**
- Teacher works alone with cognitive load
- Sequential decision-making without feedback
- Implicit pedagogical reasoning (stays in teacher's head)
- No quality checks until complete
- Expertise remains tacit

**Dialogic (COSEAQ 2.0):**
- AI-teacher partnership distributes cognitive load
- Iterative decision-making with immediate feedback
- Explicit pedagogical reasoning (verbalized through dialogue)
- Continuous quality validation
- Expertise becomes externalized and reusable

---

## PHASE 1: CONTENT ANALYSIS
### What's Really Happening

**The Pedagogical Transformation:**
- Raw content → Structured knowledge architecture
- Implicit curriculum → Explicit learning objectives
- Teacher intuition → Documented pedagogical decisions

**The Cognitive Process:**
1. **Externalization** - Teacher's implicit knowledge becomes explicit through AI prompting
2. **Structuring** - Scattered materials become organized content inventory
3. **Prioritization** - Everything the teacher "just knows" gets documented
4. **Alignment** - Personal teaching connects to curriculum requirements

**Role Dynamics:**
- **AI Role:** Question-asker, pattern-finder, structurer, validator
- **Teacher Role:** Decision-maker, priority-setter, context-provider, quality judge
- **Collaboration:** AI sees patterns teacher misses; teacher sees pedagogical nuances AI misses

**What Gets Preserved:**
- Teacher's disciplinary expertise
- Pedagogical emphasis ("detta kommer på provet")
- Student common misconceptions
- Practical examples from teaching
- Curriculum connections

**What Gets Enhanced:**
- Systematic coverage (no gaps)
- Explicit rather than implicit structure
- Documented rather than tacit knowledge
- Reusable rather than one-time

---

## PHASE 2: ASSESSMENT DESIGN
### What's Really Happening

**The Pedagogical Transformation:**
- Content knowledge → Assessable learning outcomes
- General topics → Specific, measurable objectives
- Teaching activities → Student performance criteria

**The Cognitive Process:**
1. **Translation** - Content becomes behavioral objectives ("students will be able to...")
2. **Taxonomization** - Vague goals become Bloom's-mapped objectives
3. **Distribution** - Implicit difficulty becomes explicit progression
4. **Alignment** - Teaching intentions align with assessment methods

**Role Dynamics:**
- **AI Role:** Proposes LO drafts, suggests Bloom's levels, checks alignment, identifies gaps
- **Teacher Role:** Validates appropriateness, adjusts difficulty, ensures authenticity, confirms priorities
- **Collaboration:** AI ensures systematic coverage; teacher ensures pedagogical soundness

**What Gets Preserved:**
- Teacher's assessment philosophy
- Understanding of student capability
- Constructive alignment intention
- Formative vs summative purpose

**What Gets Enhanced:**
- Complete Bloom's coverage
- Explicit difficulty progression
- Systematic gap identification
- Documentation for colleagues/reuse

---

## PHASE 3: TECHNICAL SETUP
### What's Really Happening

**The Pedagogical Transformation:**
- Assessment intentions → Technical specifications
- Educational philosophy → System configuration
- Pedagogical decisions → Metadata structure

**The Cognitive Process:**
1. **Specification** - Abstract assessment goals become concrete parameters
2. **Configuration** - Educational values translate to system settings
3. **Validation** - Technical constraints meet pedagogical requirements
4. **Documentation** - Implementation decisions become reusable templates

**Role Dynamics:**
- **AI Role:** Knows technical requirements, suggests optimal configurations, validates compliance
- **Teacher Role:** Makes pedagogical configuration choices, decides feedback strategy
- **Collaboration:** AI handles technical complexity; teacher maintains pedagogical control

**What Gets Preserved:**
- Assessment purpose (formative/summative)
- Feedback philosophy
- Time pressure decisions
- Attempt/grading strategy

**What Gets Enhanced:**
- Technical accuracy (no invalid configurations)
- Consistent implementation
- Reusable configuration templates
- Standards compliance

---

## PHASE 4: QUESTION GENERATION
### What's Really Happening

**The Pedagogical Transformation:**
- Learning objectives → Specific assessment items
- Abstract competencies → Concrete performance tasks
- Coverage intentions → Actual question distribution

**The Cognitive Process:**
1. **Operationalization** - Abstract LOs become concrete scenarios
2. **Scaffolding** - Difficulty progression becomes question sequence
3. **Distractor Design** - Misconceptions become learning opportunities
4. **Feedback Crafting** - Evaluation becomes teaching moments

**Role Dynamics:**
- **AI Role:** Generates question drafts, creates plausible distractors, suggests feedback, checks coverage
- **Teacher Role:** Validates authenticity, ensures disciplinary accuracy, refines language, approves pedagogical soundness
- **Collaboration:** AI produces volume and variety; teacher ensures quality and appropriateness

**What Gets Preserved:**
- Disciplinary accuracy and terminology
- Appropriate difficulty for students
- Pedagogical emphasis and examples
- Teaching voice and style

**What Gets Enhanced:**
- Question variety and type diversity
- Systematic LO coverage
- Constructive, educational feedback
- Efficient production at scale

**The Iteration Pattern:**
```
AI PROPOSES draft question
    ↓
TEACHER EVALUATES (authentic? appropriate? clear?)
    ↓
If GOOD → APPROVE → Next question
If NEEDS WORK → SPECIFY issues → AI REFINES → EVALUATE again
    ↓
Until ACCEPTABLE
```

## PHASE 5: QUALITY ASSURANCE
### What's Really Happening

**The Pedagogical Transformation:**
- Question collection → Validated assessment instrument
- Individual items → Coherent whole
- Unverified quality → Evidence-based confidence

**The Cognitive Process:**
1. **Multi-level Review** - Technical, pedagogical, and alignment validation
2. **Gap Analysis** - Coverage completeness check
3. **Difficulty Calibration** - Distribution analysis and adjustment
4. **Type Optimization** - Pedagogical variety assessment

**Role Dynamics:**
- **AI Role:** Systematic checking, statistical analysis, pattern identification, suggestion generation
- **Teacher Role:** Final judgment, pedagogical validation, student appropriateness assessment
- **Collaboration:** AI catches systematic issues; teacher catches contextual problems

**What Gets Preserved:**
- Teacher's quality standards
- Student appropriateness criteria
- Disciplinary accuracy requirements
- Assessment purpose alignment

**What Gets Enhanced:**
- Systematic coverage verification
- Statistical distribution analysis
- Type variety optimization
- Documentation of decisions

**Quality Dimensions Checked:**
- **Technical:** Metadata compliance, identifier uniqueness, format validity
- **Pedagogical:** LO coverage, Bloom's distribution, difficulty progression
- **Linguistic:** Clarity, appropriate level, no ambiguity
- **Accessibility:** Clear language, inclusive examples, varied representations

## PHASE 6: EXPORT & INTEGRATION
### What's Really Happening

**The Pedagogical Transformation:**
- Validated questions → Import-ready QTI XML
- Local development → LMS integration
- Teacher artifact → Institutional resource

**The Cognitive Process:**
1. **Format Translation** - Markdown → QTI XML (preserving all pedagogical intent)
2. **Metadata Integration** - Educational metadata → LMS-readable format
3. **Validation** - Import simulation and error checking
4. **Documentation** - Process and decisions documented for future reference

**Role Dynamics:**
- **AI Role:** Handles technical conversion, validates format compliance, generates documentation
- **Teacher Role:** Final approval, confirms faithful translation of intent
- **Collaboration:** AI manages complexity; teacher confirms pedagogical fidelity

**What Gets Preserved:**
- ALL pedagogical decisions and intent
- Question quality and accuracy
- Metadata and learning objectives
- Feedback and explanations

```

### The Expertise Balance

**AI Contributes:**
- Pattern recognition across materials
- Systematic completeness checking
- Technical specification knowledge
- Scale and efficiency
- Objective statistical analysis

**Teacher Contributes:**
- Pedagogical judgment and priorities
- Disciplinary expertise and accuracy
- Student understanding and appropriateness
- Context and local knowledge
- Final quality determination

**Neither Works Alone:**
- AI without teacher = technically correct but pedagogically hollow
- Teacher without AI = pedagogically sound but inefficiently produced
