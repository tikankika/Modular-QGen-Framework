# BUILDING BLOCK 3a: INTRODUCTION & FOUNDATIONS

**Component:** Building Block 3a  
**Framework:** Modular Question Generation System  
**Classification:** 🔶 STATIC (checklist-driven compliance)  
**Primary Input:** Building Block 2 (Assessment Blueprint)  
**Primary Output:** Technical Metadata Configuration Document  
**Purpose:** Establish platform-compliant technical foundation  
**Estimated Duration:** 30 minutes total (for all BB3 stages)

## OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE

Building Block 3 represents the technical translation layer between pedagogical design and platform implementation. This component transforms the assessment blueprint from Building Block 2 into technical specifications that ensure all generated questions will function properly within the target Learning Management System (LMS), with particular emphasis on Inspera's requirements.

The technical setup process operates through systematic compliance checking rather than pedagogical dialogue. Where Building Blocks 1 and 2 required teacher judgment and iterative refinement, Building Block 3 follows predetermined technical specifications that ensure platform compatibility. This static nature reflects the binary requirements of technical systems—metadata either complies with platform specifications or it does not.

## THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

### Technical Interoperability

Building Block 3 operationalizes principles of technical interoperability as defined by the IMS Global Learning Consortium standards, particularly QTI 2.2 (Question and Test Interoperability). These standards ensure that assessment content can move between compliant systems while preserving both content and metadata integrity.

### Metadata as Organizational Infrastructure

The label system implemented in Building Block 3 creates information infrastructure—invisible support systems that enable visible work. In the context of question banks, metadata labels function as the organizational infrastructure that makes large collections of questions manageable and useful.

Effective metadata design follows established principles from information science: metadata should be purposeful (serving identified needs), practical (feasible to implement), and principled (following consistent rules). Building Block 3 operationalizes these principles through structured label categories.

## ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

**Primary Requirement:** Completed Assessment Blueprint from Building Block 2:
- Defined learning objectives with unique identifiers
- Selected question types from the blueprint
- Assessment configuration (formative/summative, feedback timing)
- Language specification

**Secondary Requirements:**
- LMS platform name (Inspera, Canvas, Moodle, etc.)
- Course identifier or code
- Any institution-specific metadata requirements

**Optional Inputs:**
- Previous metadata configurations for reference
- Established label conventions
- Department or program-specific requirements

## PROCESS OVERVIEW: FIVE STAGES

Building Block 3 follows a structured five-stage process that transforms pedagogical specifications into technical configurations:

1. **Stage 1: Platform Orientation** (bb3b)
   - Establishes understanding of system requirements
   - Reviews platform-specific constraints
   - Clarifies technical terminology

2. **Stage 2: Metadata Field Configuration** (bb3c)
   - Captures required technical information
   - Configures assessment identification
   - Maps learning objectives

3. **Stage 3: Label System Design** (bb3d)
   - Creates searchable organizational structure
   - Establishes topic categorization
   - Defines cognitive level indicators

4. **Stage 4: Question Type Mapping** (bb3e)
   - Connects pedagogical types to technical codes
   - Verifies platform support
   - Documents scoring implications

5. **Stage 5: Technical Validation** (bb3f)
   - Confirms compliance and completeness
   - Cross-references all specifications
   - Validates platform compatibility
