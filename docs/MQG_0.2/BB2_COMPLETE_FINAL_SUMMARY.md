## OVERLAP ANALYSIS STATISTICS

**Total Files Analyzed:** 9  
**Total Lines Analyzed:** ~3,000 lines  
**Total Overlap Instances Examined:** 50+  

**Critical Overlaps Found:** **0**  
**Moderate Overlaps Found:** **0**  
**Problematic Duplications Found:** **0**

**Appropriate Cross-References:** 50+ (all intentional and correct)

---

## MODULAR DOCUMENTATION PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

### Pattern 1: Theory → Practice with Explicit Cross-References ⭐

**Implementation:**
- **bb2a (theory):** "Bloom's taxonomy provides cognitive architecture... For detailed definitions, see bb2e"
- **bb2e (practice):** Complete Bloom's definitions with action verbs and examples

**Also Used For:**
- **bb2a (theory):** "Different question formats offer distinct affordances... For comprehensive descriptions, see bb2f"
- **bb2f (practice):** Complete question type descriptions for all 10 types

**Result:** Perfect separation of theory and operational reference with clear navigation

---

### Pattern 2: Intentional Repetition for Safety ⭐

**Implementation:**
- **Stage gates** appear in ALL stage files (bb2b-bb2h)
- Identical "STOP/WAIT/DO NOT" format
- Prevents auto-advancement between stages
- Critical framework integrity mechanism

**Result:** Deliberate repetition for safety, not problematic duplication

---

### Pattern 3: Sequential Stage Dependencies ⭐

**Implementation:**
- bb2c establishes constraints → bb2d applies them
- bb2e creates Bloom's distribution → bb2f implements with question types
- bb2g extends bb2e with difficulty dimension
- bb2h synthesizes all outputs into blueprint

**Result:** Perfect data flow, no premature decisions, each stage builds on previous

---

### Pattern 4: Meta-Guidance vs. Implementation ⭐

**Implementation:**
- **Stage files (bb2b-bb2h):** Show how to do things (dialogue examples, procedures)
- **bb2i:** Explains why things work that way (principles, troubleshooting)

**Result:** Cross-cutting guidance complements stage-specific content without duplication

---

## REVISIONS IMPLEMENTED

**Total Revisions Across BB2:** 11 files updated

**bb2a (Introduction):**
- 5 enhancements implemented

---

## OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS IDENTIFIED (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Total Optional Enhancements Available:** 15 across 7 files

**Low Priority (Not Implemented):**

- bb2g: Prerequisites note + cognitive × difficulty example (2 enhancements)
