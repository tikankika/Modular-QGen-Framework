# BUILDING BLOCK 3f: STAGE 5 - TECHNICAL VALIDATION

**Component:** Building Block 3f  
**Framework:** Modular Question Generation System  
**Stage:** 5 of 5  
**Purpose:** Validate technical configuration completeness and compliance

---

## STAGE 5: TECHNICAL VALIDATION

### Purpose

Stage 5 performs systematic validation of all technical configurations before proceeding to question generation. This validation prevents downstream errors that would be costly to correct after questions are written. Only after successful validation does the technical configuration become final.

## VALIDATION DIMENSIONS

### Completeness Validation

**Required Fields Check:**
- All metadata fields populated (from Stage 2)
- All learning objectives mapped with IDs
- All question types mapped to technical codes (from Stage 4)
- Label system comprehensive (from Stage 3)
- Assessment configuration complete

**Missing Items:** [List any incomplete elements]

### Consistency Validation

**Internal Consistency:**
- Identifier unique (no system conflicts)
- Language code matches content language
- Subject field matches course code label
- Question types match BB2 blueprint quantities
- LO IDs consistent across stages

**Inconsistencies Found:** [List any conflicts]

### Compliance Validation

**Platform Requirements:**
- Character limits respected
- Required formats followed
- Platform constraints satisfied
- Institutional requirements met
- QTI compliance verified

**Compliance Issues:** [List any violations]

### Cross-Reference Validation

**BB2 Blueprint Alignment:**
- LO count matches BB2 output
- Question types match BB2 specifications
- Question type quantities match blueprint
- Assessment configuration matches BB2 strategy
- Language matches instructional context

**Alignment Issues:** [List any mismatches]

## VALIDATION RESULT

**Overall Status:** [PASS / REVISE]

**If PASS:**
✅ All validation dimensions satisfied
✅ Configuration complete and compliant
✅ Ready to proceed to Building Block 4

**If REVISE:**
❌ Specific issues identified:
1. [Issue description and resolution needed]
2. [Issue description and resolution needed]
3. [Issue description and resolution needed]

**Resolution Required:**
- Return to relevant stage(s) to address issues
- Re-validate after corrections
- Proceed only after PASS status achieved

---

## ERROR RESOLUTION WORKFLOW

**For Completeness Issues:**
- Return to Stage 2 (metadata) or Stage 3 (labels) or Stage 4 (types)
- Complete missing information
- Re-validate

**For Consistency Issues:**
- Identify conflicting specifications
- Resolve conflicts (may require BB2 consultation)
- Update relevant stage
- Re-validate

**For Compliance Issues:**
- Review platform requirements
- Adjust specifications to meet constraints
- May require BB2 revision if constraints conflict with design
- Re-validate

**For Cross-Reference Issues:**
- Compare BB3 specifications against BB2 blueprint
- Identify discrepancies
- Align specifications with blueprint (or revise blueprint if needed)
- Re-validate

## STAGE 5 COMPLETION CHECKPOINT

**This stage is now complete.**

### Completion Verification
- All validation checks passed
- No outstanding issues
- Configuration frozen and documented
- Ready for question generation

**Status:** Complete when validation PASS achieved

**Next component:** bb3g (Output & Implementation) for final documentation
