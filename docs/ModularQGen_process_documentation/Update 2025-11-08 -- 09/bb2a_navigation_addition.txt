## USING THIS DOCUMENTATION

Building Block 2 documentation is organized into modular files for easier navigation and maintenance:

**MQG_bb2a_Introduction_Foundations.md** (this file)
- Theoretical foundations
- Process architecture
- Entry points and prerequisites

**MQG_bb2b_Stage1_Objective_Validation.md**
- Validates learning objectives for assessment
- Ensures objectives are observable, measurable, comprehensive
- Stage gate: STOP before Stage 2

**MQG_bb2c_Stage2_Strategy_Definition.md**
- Establishes assessment purpose and constraints
- Formative vs. summative considerations
- Stage gate: STOP before Stage 3

**MQG_bb2d_Stage3_Question_Target.md**
- Determines total number of questions
- Coverage-based calculations
- Time-based validation
- Stage gate: STOP before Stage 4

**MQG_bb2e_Stage4_Blooms_Distribution.md**
- Allocates questions across cognitive levels
- Remember through Evaluate distribution
- Stage gate: STOP before Stage 5

**MQG_bb2f_Stage5_Question_Type_Mix.md**
- Selects question format types
- MC-Single, MC-Multiple, Text Area, etc.
- Stage gate: STOP before Stage 6

**MQG_bb2g_Stage6_Difficulty_Distribution.md**
- Distributes questions by difficulty
- Easy, Medium, Hard levels
- Stage gate: STOP before Stage 7

**MQG_bb2h_Stage7_Blueprint_Construction.md**
- Synthesizes all decisions into blueprint
- Comprehensive validation checks
- Final approval protocol
- Stage gate: STOP before BB3/BB4

**MQG_bb2i_Facilitation_Best_Practices.md** (optional)
- Guidance for AI systems
- Guidance for teachers
- Common pitfalls and solutions

### Sequential Navigation

Each stage file includes:
- Clear prerequisites
- Stage-specific content
- Completion checkpoint
- Explicit STOP command
- Requirements for next stage

**CRITICAL:** Do not proceed between stages without explicit teacher approval at each checkpoint.

### Prerequisites

Before starting Building Block 2, ensure:

**Required from Building Block 1:**
- Validated learning objectives
- Content tier assignments (Tier 1, 2, 3)
- Bloom's level classifications
- Connection to instructional materials

**OR Alternative Entry:**
- Predetermined curriculum objectives (Standards-Based Entry)
- Existing assessment to improve (Revision Entry)

**Time Commitment:**
- Stage 1: 15-20 minutes
- Stage 2: 10-15 minutes
- Stage 3: 10-15 minutes
- Stage 4: 15-20 minutes
- Stage 5: 20-25 minutes
- Stage 6: 15-20 minutes
- Stage 7: 20-30 minutes
- **Total:** 1.5-2.5 hours for complete blueprint

**Technical Requirements:**
- Knowledge of target LMS platform capabilities
- Understanding of available grading resources
- Assessment time constraints
- Student enrollment numbers
