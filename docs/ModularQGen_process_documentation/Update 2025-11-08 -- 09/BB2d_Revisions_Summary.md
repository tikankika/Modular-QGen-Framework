# BB2d REVISIONS SUMMARY

**File Modified:** MQG_bb2d_Stage3_Question_Target.md  
**Revision Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Changes Implemented:** 2 optional enhancements

---

## REVISIONS MADE

### Enhancement 1: Prerequisites Note Added ✅

**Location:** After header (line 7), before "STAGE 3: QUESTION TARGET DETERMINATION"

**Lines Added:** 2

**Content Added:**
```markdown
**Prerequisites:** bb2b (Stage 1: Learning objectives validated), bb2c (Stage 2: 
Assessment purpose and constraints established). This stage uses objective count 
and time constraints from previous stages.
```

**Rationale:**
- Clarifies stage dependencies
- Helps users understand what information feeds into Stage 3
- Consistent with other enhanced bb2 files (bb2b, bb2c)
- Improves navigation and context

**Priority:** VERY LOW (enhancement only)

---

### Enhancement 2: Weighted Distribution Example Added ✅

**Location:** After line 123 (within "Uneven Objective Distribution Consideration" section)

**Lines Added:** 13

**Content Added:**
```markdown
**Example Weighted Distribution Calculation:**

Total: 20 questions across 5 learning objectives (3 Tier 1 essential, 2 Tier 2 important)

*Weighted approach:*
- Tier 1 (essential): 60% × 20 = 12 questions ÷ 3 objectives = 4 questions per Tier 1 objective
- Tier 2 (important): 40% × 20 = 8 questions ÷ 2 objectives = 4 questions per Tier 2 objective

*Even approach for comparison:*
- All tiers: 20 questions ÷ 5 objectives = 4 questions per objective

In this example, even distribution yields same per-objective count due to the numbers, 
but with different totals (e.g., 25 questions, 4 Tier 1, 3 Tier 2), weighted ensures 
Tier 1 receives 15 questions (60%) versus Tier 2's 10 questions (40%), better reflecting 
content priorities.
```

**Rationale:**
- Provides concrete worked example of weighted distribution
- Shows calculation mechanics clearly
- Compares weighted vs. even approaches
- Demonstrates how weighting reflects content priorities
- Addresses conceptual understanding with practical demonstration

**Priority:** LOW (enhancement only - concept was already clear)

## CHANGES SUMMARY

**Total Lines Added:** 15 (2 + 13)

**Total Lines Removed:** 0

**File Size Change:** 186 lines → 201 lines (+15 lines, +8% increase)

**Content Changes:**
- Prerequisites context: Added
- Weighted distribution example: Added
- Calculation demonstration: Added
- No removals: All original content retained

## BEFORE AND AFTER COMPARISON

### Before Enhancement 1:
```markdown
**Purpose:** Determines appropriate total number of questions for the assessment

---

## STAGE 3: QUESTION TARGET DETERMINATION
```

### After Enhancement 1:
```markdown
**Purpose:** Determines appropriate total number of questions for the assessment

**Prerequisites:** bb2b (Stage 1: Learning objectives validated), bb2c (Stage 2: 
Assessment purpose and constraints established). This stage uses objective count 
and time constraints from previous stages.

## STAGE 3: QUESTION TARGET DETERMINATION
```

---

### Before Enhancement 2:
```markdown
Most teachers choose weighted distribution aligned with content tiers from Building Block 1, 
ensuring essential content receives proportionally more assessment attention than enrichment 
content.

### Stage 3 Checkpoint
```

### After Enhancement 2:
```markdown
Most teachers choose weighted distribution aligned with content tiers from Building Block 1, 
ensuring essential content receives proportionally more assessment attention than enrichment 
content.

### Stage 3 Checkpoint
