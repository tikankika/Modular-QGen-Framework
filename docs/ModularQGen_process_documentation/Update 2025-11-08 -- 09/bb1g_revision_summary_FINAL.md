# REVISION SUMMARY: BB1g Enhancements - FINAL FILE

**Date:** November 2025  
**File Modified:** MQG_bb1g_Stage5_Scope_Objectives.md  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED - BB1 COMPLETE!

---

## CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. New Section: "Context" (17 lines)
**Location:** Before PART A  
**Lines Added:** 17 lines (including section header and separator)

**Content Added:**
```markdown
### Context

Stage 5 is the synthesis stage that integrates ALL previous work into validated 
learning objectives. This stage has two parts:

**PART A: Scope Boundaries** - Clarifies what's IN/OUT of assessment scope based 
on Stages 0-2 content architecture and emphasis patterns.

**PART B: Learning Objectives Synthesis** - Creates learning objectives by integrating:
- Stage 0: Content architecture (Tiers 1-4)
- Stage 1: Validated priority structure
- Stage 2: Emphasis rationale and assessment focus
- Stage 3: Instructional examples
- Stage 4: Common misconceptions

This is the final BB1 stage - outputs become the foundation for BB2 (Assessment Design).
```

**Purpose:** Explains Stage 5's integrative synthesis purpose, outlining how it combines all previous stages into final learning objectives.

---

### 2. New Section: "Bloom's Level Decision Guide" (17 lines)
**Location:** After Bloom's Taxonomy Application in PART B  
**Lines Added:** 17 lines (including section header and separator)

**Content Added:**
```markdown
#### Bloom's Level Decision Guide

**When uncertain between levels:**

**Remember vs. Understand:**
- Remember: Can they recall/recognize without explanation? → Remember
- Understand: Must they explain WHY or HOW? → Understand

**Understand vs. Apply:**
- Understand: Explaining a concept in their own words → Understand
- Apply: Using the concept in a NEW scenario → Apply

**Apply vs. Analyze:**
- Apply: Using a procedure/method in a situation → Apply
- Analyze: Breaking down relationships, comparing/contrasting → Analyze

**Analyze vs. Evaluate:**
- Analyze: Examining components and relationships → Analyze
- Evaluate: Making judgments with justification → Evaluate

**Default to lower level when uncertain** - easier to assess validly.
```

**Purpose:** Provides decision criteria for distinguishing between Bloom's levels in ambiguous cases, with default guidance to lower levels for assessment validity.

---

### 3. New Section: "Objective Count Guidelines" (15 lines)
**Location:** After Bloom's Level Decision Guide in PART B  
**Lines Added:** 15 lines (including section header and separator)

**Content Added:**
```markdown
#### Objective Count Guidelines

**Target Ranges:**
- Total objectives: 15-30 (depending on course scope)
- Tier 1: 10-20 objectives (majority of assessment)
- Tier 2: 3-8 objectives (supplementary assessment)
- Tier 3: 0-2 objectives (background, if included)

**Quality over Quantity:**
- Better to have 15 well-crafted objectives than 40 vague ones
- Each objective should be specific, measurable, and evidence-based
- Combine related learning goals rather than splitting unnecessarily

**Red Flags:**
- <10 total objectives: Probably too few, missing important learning goals
- >40 total objectives: Too many, likely splitting hairs or including background content
```

**Purpose:** Provides target ranges for objective counts, emphasizes quality over quantity, and identifies red flags for too many/too few objectives.

---

### 4. New Section: "Systematic Presentation Strategy" (12 lines)
**Location:** At beginning of Validation Dialogue in PART B  
**Lines Added:** 12 lines (including separator)

**Content Added:**
```markdown
**Systematic Presentation Strategy:**

1. **Present by topic** (not by Bloom's level) - keeps context clear
2. **Show all objectives for a topic together** - teacher sees complete picture
3. **Highlight evidence and examples** for each objective
4. **After each topic, pause for feedback** before moving to next
5. **Take notes on requested changes** but don't interrupt flow
6. **After all topics presented, go back and make revisions**

This prevents fragmentation and allows teacher to see the complete learning story 
for each topic before commenting.
```

**Purpose:** Guides systematic presentation of all objectives, maintaining topic context and allowing comprehensive feedback before revisions.

---

### 5. Expanded Section: "Supporting Documentation" (7 lines)
**Location:** Beginning of Supporting Documentation section in Final Output Format  
**Lines Added:** 7 lines

**Content Added:**
```markdown
**Where Documents Are Saved:**
All BB1 outputs are saved in the BB1 output package directory:
- Validated Learning Objectives (this document)
- Content Analysis (from Stage 0)
- Example Catalog (from Stage 3)
- Misconception Registry (from Stage 4)
```

**Purpose:** Clarifies where all BB1 output documents are saved, providing clear file organization guidance.

---

## TOTAL CHANGES
