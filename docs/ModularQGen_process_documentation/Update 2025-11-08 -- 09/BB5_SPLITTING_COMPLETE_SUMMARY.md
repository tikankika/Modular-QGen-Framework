## STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Modular Organization
- Each phase in separate file
- Clear phase boundaries
- Independent documentation
- Easy navigation and updates

### Stage Gate Implementation
- Explicit completion checkpoints at end of each phase
- "WAIT for explicit instruction" commands
- Prevention of automatic progression
- Teacher approval required between phases

### Enhanced Detail
- Comprehensive validation procedures
- Clear decision criteria
- Practical examples throughout
- Troubleshooting guidance

---

## COMPARISON TO ORIGINAL

### Original BB5 (MQG_bb5_Quality_Assurance.md)
- Single file: 351 lines
- All phases combined
- General overview
- Limited phase detail

### New BB5 (bb5a through bb5f)
- 6 modular files: ~1,765 lines total
- Phase-specific documentation
- Detailed procedures
- Stage gates implemented
- Comprehensive examples
- Clear workflows

---

## CLEANUP REQUIRED

**Old File to Remove:**
- `/Users/niklaskarlsson/AIED_EdTech_Dev_documentation_projects/Modular QGen - Modular Question Generation Framework/docs/MQG_0.2/MQG_bb5_Quality_Assurance.md`

This file has been replaced by bb5a-bb5f modular files.

---

## PROGRESS SUMMARY

### COMPLETED ✅
- **BB1**: Split into 8 files (bb1a-bb1h) + overlap analysis + stage gates
- **BB2**: Split into 9 files (bb2a-bb2i)
- **BB3**: Split into 7 files (bb3a-bb3g)
- **BB5**: Split into 6 files (bb5a-bb5f) ← **JUST COMPLETED**

### IN PROGRESS 🟡
- **BB1 Overlap Analysis**: Completed bb1a, bb1b, bb1c, bb1h
  - Still need: bb1d, bb1e, bb1f, bb1g

### PENDING ⏳
- **BB4**: Needs splitting and development
- **BB6**: Needs review and potential splitting
- **Overlap Analysis**: BB2, BB3, BB5 files need overlap checking

---

## NEXT STEPS

**Option A**: Continue BB1 overlap analysis (bb1d through bb1g)  
**Option B**: Analyze BB2, BB3, BB5 for overlaps  
**Option C**: Work on BB4 development and splitting  
**Option D**: Review and potentially split BB6  
**Option E**: Clean up old files (remove replaced versions)

---

**Document Status:** BB5 Splitting Complete  
**Files Created:** 6  
**Stage Gates:** Implemented  
**Quality:** Enhanced with detailed procedures  
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR USE
