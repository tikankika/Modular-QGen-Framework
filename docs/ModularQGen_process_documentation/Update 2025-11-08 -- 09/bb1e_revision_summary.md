# REVISION SUMMARY: BB1e Enhancements

**Date:** November 2025  
**File Modified:** MQG_bb1e_Stage3_Example_Catalog.md  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

---

## CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. New Section: "Context" (13 lines)
**Location:** Before "Opening Context" in FOR CLAUDE section  
**Lines Added:** 13 lines (including section header and separator)

**Content Added:**
```markdown
#### Context

Stage 3 builds on Stage 0's initial example identification. During material 
analysis, Claude noted examples, demonstrations, and activities used in instruction. 
Stage 3 systematically expands this preliminary list through dialogue.

At this point:
- Stage 0 provided initial example catalog (preliminary, incomplete)
- Stage 2 discussed which examples worked best for emphasis topics
- Stage 3 comprehensively documents ALL effective examples

This stage focuses on cataloging examples that can become question scenarios in BB4.
```

**Purpose:** Connects Stage 3 to Stage 0's initial example identification, clarifying that this stage expands rather than replaces the preliminary catalog.

---

### 2. New Section: "Topic Progression Strategy" (14 lines)
**Location:** After "Opening Context" in FOR CLAUDE section  
**Lines Added:** 14 lines (including section header and separator)

**Content Added:**
```markdown
#### Topic Progression Strategy

Work through content systematically:

1. **Start with Stage 0's example list** as reference (don't start from scratch)
2. **Work through Tier 1 topics** in order (chronological from Stage 0)
3. **For each topic, ask all 5 inquiry areas** (Primary, Demonstrations, Real-world, 
   Visual, Case studies)
4. **After Tier 1 complete**, briefly catalog Tier 2 examples if significant
5. **Skip Tier 3/4 examples** (background only, not for assessment)

Refer to Stage 0's preliminary list to prompt teacher memory, then expand with dialogue.
```

**Purpose:** Guides systematic progression through topics, emphasizing use of Stage 0 list as starting point rather than starting from scratch.

---

### 3. New Section: "Example Selection Criteria" (18 lines)
**Location:** After "Systematic Inquiry" in FOR CLAUDE section  
**Lines Added:** 18 lines (including section header and separator)

**Content Added:**
```markdown
#### Example Selection Criteria

**Quality over Quantity:**
- Focus on examples that were EFFECTIVE (students understood)
- Include examples you'd DEFINITELY use again
- Prioritize examples with MEMORABLE student response

**Quantity Guidelines:**
- Tier 1 topics: 2-4 examples each (depending on topic complexity)
- Tier 2 topics: 1-2 examples each
- Total target: 15-25 examples across all topics (not exhaustive)

Don't catalog every example mentioned in materials—focus on the best ones.
```

**Purpose:** Provides clear guidance on quality vs. quantity and target numbers, preventing exhaustive but unhelpful cataloging of every mentioned example.

---

### 4. Expanded Section: "Documentation Focus" (3 lines)
**Location:** End of "Documentation Focus" section in FOR CLAUDE  
**Lines Added:** 3 lines

**Content Added:**
```markdown
**Where to Document:**
Create Example Catalog document (part of BB1 output package). This catalog will be 
referenced in Stage 5 learning objectives and used in BB4 question scenario development.
```

**Purpose:** Clarifies where the catalog document is created and how it connects to later stages.

---

### 5. Added Domain Note in FOR TEACHERS (2 lines)
**Location:** After student response example in FOR TEACHERS section  
**Lines Added:** 2 lines

**Content Added:**
```markdown
**Note:** This example is from an environmental science course. Your examples will 
reflect your subject area (e.g., cell diagrams in biology, proofs in mathematics, 
primary sources in history, etc.).
```

**Purpose:** Acknowledges domain-specificity and encourages adaptation to teacher's subject area.

---

## TOTAL CHANGES

**Total Lines Added:** 50 lines  
**Sections Added:** 3 new sections (Context, Topic Progression Strategy, Example Selection Criteria)  
**Sections Expanded:** 1 existing section (Documentation Focus)  
**Notes Added:** 1 domain note (FOR TEACHERS)

---

## IMPACT ON FILE

### Before Enhancements:
- **Total Lines:** 197 (with stage gate)
- No Stage 0 reference
- No topic progression guidance
- No selection criteria (quality vs. quantity)
- Unclear documentation location
- Domain-specific example without note

### After Enhancements:
- **Total Lines:** 247 (with stage gate + enhancements)
- Clear connection to Stage 0's preliminary catalog
- Systematic topic progression strategy
- Quality criteria and quantity guidelines (15-25 examples)
- Documentation location specified
- Example acknowledged as domain-specific

---

## IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED

✅ **Better Context:** Stage 3 now clearly builds on Stage 0  
✅ **Systematic Progression:** Start with Stage 0 list, work through Tier 1 systematically  
✅ **Quality Guidance:** Focus on best examples (15-25 total), not exhaustive cataloging  
✅ **Documentation Clarity:** Example Catalog document location and purpose explained  
✅ **Generalizability:** Example noted as domain-specific with subject-specific alternatives  
✅ **Prevents Duplication:** References Stage 0 list to avoid starting from scratch

## FILES STATUS UPDATE

**Building Block 1 - Content Analysis:**

**Completed Files (6 of 8):**
- ✅ bb1a: Revised (navigation, prerequisites, file dependencies)
- ✅ bb1b: Revised (troubleshooting, teacher guidance, Stage 0 gate)
- ✅ bb1c: Enhanced (context, documentation, misalignment handling, Stage 1 gate)
- ✅ bb1d: Enhanced (context, topic progression, documentation, Stage 2 gate)
- ✅ bb1e: Enhanced (context, topic progression, selection criteria, Stage 3 gate)
- ✅ bb1h: Revised (removed duplications)

**Remaining Files (2 of 8):**
- ⏳ bb1f: Stage 4 - Misconception Analysis (has Stage 4 gate, needs overlap analysis)
- ⏳ bb1g: Stage 5 - Scope & Objectives (has Stage 5 gate, needs overlap analysis)

---

## NEXT STEPS

**Immediate:**
1. Proceed to bb1f (Stage 4: Misconception Analysis) overlap analysis
2. Continue with bb1g (Stage 5: Scope & Objectives) overlap analysis
3. Implement any recommended revisions for remaining files

**Upon Completion:**
- All bb1 files will be revised, enhanced, and have stage gates
- Complete BB1 documentation package ready for testing
- Can proceed with real-world testing using cells/virus materials

---

**Revision Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Next File:** bb1f (Stage 4: Misconception Analysis)  
**Progress:** 75% of bb1 files complete (6 of 8)
