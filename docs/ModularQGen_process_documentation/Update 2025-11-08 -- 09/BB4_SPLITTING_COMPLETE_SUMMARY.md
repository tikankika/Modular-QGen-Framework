## STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Three-Stage Model Clearly Separated
- Stage 4A: Content creation (explorative dialogue)
- Stage 4B: Distribution analysis (analytical dialogue)
- Stage 4C: Technical formatting (implementation dialogue)

### Teacher-Centric Design
- Teacher's decision authority emphasized throughout
- Clear specification of what AI must never do
- Pedagogical control maintained at all stages

### Stage Gate Implementation
- Explicit completion checkpoints at end of each stage
- "WAIT for explicit instruction" commands
- Prevention of automatic progression
- Teacher approval required between stages

### Rich Dialogue Examples
- 9 detailed dialogue scenarios across the files
- Real-world examples from different disciplines
- Shows both good and problematic interactions
- Demonstrates iteration patterns

### Enhanced Detail
- Step-by-step processes for each stage
- Clear decision criteria
- Practical implementation guidance
- Troubleshooting for common issues

## COMPARISON TO ORIGINAL

### Original BB4 (MQG_BB4_Complete_Teacher_Led_Process_01.md)
- Single file: 425 lines
- All stages combined
- General overview with examples
- Teacher-driven approach emphasized

### New BB4 (bb4a through bb4e)
- 5 modular files: ~2,445 lines total
- Stage-specific documentation
- Detailed processes and procedures
- Stage gates implemented
- Comprehensive dialogue examples
- Clear workflows and checklists
