Due to filesystem tool limitations, created comprehensive instructions for:

**Stage Gates for bb2b and bb2c:**
- Exact text to find and replace
- Complete checkpoint sections
- Verification guidelines
- Available in: `BB2_MANUAL_STAGE_GATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### 4. 📝 Created Navigation Guide for bb2a

**Navigation addition for bb2a:**
- Complete file structure overview

2. MQG_bb2e_Stage4_Blooms_Distribution.md
3. MQG_bb2f_Stage5_Question_Type_Mix.md
4. MQG_bb2g_Stage6_Difficulty_Distribution.md

**⚠️ NEED STAGE GATES (2 files):**
5. MQG_bb2b_Stage1_Objective_Validation.md - Manual addition required
6. MQG_bb2c_Stage2_Strategy_Definition.md - Manual addition required

**⚠️ NEEDS NAVIGATION (1 file):**
7. MQG_bb2a_Introduction_Foundations.md - Manual addition required

**⚠️ STATUS UNCERTAIN (1 file):**
8. MQG_bb2h_Stage7_Blueprint_Construction.md - Verify existence

**NOT YET CREATED (1 optional file):**
9. MQG_bb2i_Facilitation_Best_Practices.md - Optional enhancement

## MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED

### Priority 1: URGENT - Add Stage Gates (5 minutes)

**File:** MQG_bb2b_Stage1_Objective_Validation.md
- Find: "Only after explicit teacher confirmation does the process advance to Stage 2."
- Add: Stage 1 Completion Checkpoint section (see BB2_MANUAL_STAGE_GATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**File:** MQG_bb2c_Stage2_Strategy_Definition.md
- Find: "Only with explicit confirmation does Building Block 2 advance to..."
- Add: Stage 2 Completion Checkpoint section (see BB2_MANUAL_STAGE_GATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**Why Urgent:** Without stage gates, Claude will improvise and skip ahead without approval

### Priority 2: RECOMMENDED - Add Navigation (5 minutes)

**File:** MQG_bb2a_Introduction_Foundations.md
- Add: "USING THIS DOCUMENTATION" section (see bb2a_navigation_addition.txt)
- Location: After "Process Overview: Seven Connected Stages"

**Why Recommended:** Improves usability, matches bb1a structure

### Priority 3: VERIFY - Check bb2h Creation

**File:** MQG_bb2h_Stage7_Blueprint_Construction.md
- Check if file exists at expected path
- If NOT: Content available in conversation history (573 lines)
- If YES: Proceed to next steps

### Priority 4: OPTIONAL - Create Facilitation Guide (30 minutes)

**File:** MQG_bb2i_Facilitation_Best_Practices.md (not yet created)
- Similar structure to bb1h
- Guidance for AI systems
- Guidance for teachers
- Common pitfalls and solutions

**Why Optional:** Enhances usability but not critical for functionality

## COMPARISON TO BB1

**BB1 (Content Analysis):**
- 8 modular files
- All files have stage gates ✅
- All overlaps analyzed ✅
- BB1_COMPLETE_FINAL_SUMMARY.md ✅
- Status: 100% COMPLETE

**BB2 (Assessment Design):**
- 8-9 modular files (depending on bb2h/bb2i)
- 4 files have stage gates, 2 need them ⚠️
- 1 file needs navigation ⚠️
- Overlaps not yet analyzed
- BB2_COMPLETE_FINAL_SUMMARY.md not yet created
- Status: ~85-90% COMPLETE

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### If bb2h EXISTS and stage gates are added:

**1. Run Comprehensive Overlap Analysis (2-3 hours)**
- Analyze each bb2 file like we did for bb1
- Identify redundancies across files
- Refine cross-references
- Document gaps and enhancements

**2. Create BB2_COMPLETE_FINAL_SUMMARY.md**
- Like BB1_COMPLETE_FINAL_SUMMARY.md
- Document all revisions made
- Summarize BB2 structure
- Provide usage guidance

**3. Optional: Create bb2i Facilitation Guide**
- Extract operational notes from original BB2
- Add stage-specific guidance
- Document common pitfalls

### If bb2h DOES NOT exist:

**1. Create bb2h First**
- Content already prepared (573 lines)
- Try alternative creation method
- Or paste manually from conversation

**2. Then proceed with overlap analysis**
