# BB1g OVERLAP ANALYSIS: Stage 5 - Scope & Learning Objectives

**File Analyzed:** MQG_bb1g_Stage5_Scope_Objectives.md (485 lines with stage gate)  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS COMPLETE

---

## OVERLAPS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Tier Structure References (with bb1b Stage 0)

**bb1g (Throughout PART A and PART B):**
```
- Tier 1 content is definitely in scope
- Tier 2 content, should we assess it
- Tier 3 content - combine into broader objectives OR skip
- Tier 4 content completely excluded
```

**bb1b (Stage 0):**
- Defines Tier 1-4 structure

**ASSESSMENT:**
- **Overlap Type:** Appropriate usage of defined structure
- **Severity:** NONE (correct reference)
- **Recommendation:** KEEP - bb1g correctly uses Tier structure throughout

---

### 2. Examples and Misconceptions Integration (with bb1e, bb1f)

**bb1g (Integration Logic):**
```
From examples catalog:
- Ensure objectives can be demonstrated via available examples
- Reference examples in objective evidence

From misconception registry:
- Ensure objectives address understanding, not just recall
- Frame objectives to counter misconceptions
```

**bb1e and bb1f:**
- Stage 3 creates Example Catalog
- Stage 4 creates Misconception Registry

**ASSESSMENT:**
- **Overlap Type:** Appropriate forward reference and integration
- **Severity:** NONE (correct sequential flow)
- **Recommendation:** KEEP - bb1g correctly synthesizes from Stages 3-4

---

### 3. Bloom's Taxonomy (with bb1g itself - internal)

**bb1g (Multiple locations):**
- Bloom's Taxonomy Application (PART B - lines with verbs)
- Draft Presentation Format (references Bloom's levels)
- Validation Dialogue (discusses Bloom's levels)
- FOR TEACHERS (About Bloom's Levels section)

**ASSESSMENT:**
- **Overlap Type:** Internal repetition (within bb1g)
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Recommendation:** KEEP - Different contexts require repeated reference
  - First: Technical reference for Claude
  - Second: Format showing structure
  - Third: Handling common issues
  - Fourth: Teacher-friendly explanation
  - Not redundant - serves different purposes in different sections

---

### 4. BB1 vs BB2 Distinction (with bb1a)

**bb1g (Transition to BB2):**
```
**BB2 will:**
- Define assessment purpose and strategy
- Determine total question count
...

**BB2 will NOT:**
- Change these learning objectives (they're validated)
- Re-analyze content (that's complete)
- Create actual questions (that's BB4)
```

**bb1a (Fundamental Principles):**
```
BB1 DESCRIBES what was taught - the conducted instruction
BB2 DESIGNS how to assess it - the assessment strategy
```

**ASSESSMENT:**
- **Overlap Type:** Principle vs. detailed explanation
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Recommendation:** KEEP BOTH
  - bb1a: States the fundamental principle
  - bb1g: Explains transition practically
  - Different levels of detail serve different purposes

---

### 5. Validation Process (with bb1h facilitation principles)

**bb1g (Validation Dialogue + FOR TEACHERS):**
- Presents objectives systematically
- Handles teacher feedback
- Iterative refinement process

**bb1h (Dialogue Facilitation Principles):**
- Validate continuously
- Handle feedback gracefully
- Iterate until validated

**ASSESSMENT:**
- **Overlap Type:** General principle vs. specific implementation
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Recommendation:** KEEP BOTH
  - bb1h: General facilitation principles
  - bb1g: Stage 5-specific validation dialogue
  - Complementary, not redundant

---

## CONTENT GAPS IDENTIFIED

### Gap 1: Missing Context on Synthesis Foundation

**Current State:**
- PART A starts with "Before synthesizing learning objectives..."
- PART B starts with "Process: 1. Integrate all dialogue data from Stages 0-5"
- BUT doesn't explain WHAT Stage 5 synthesizes or WHY

**Recommendation:**
ADD "Context" section before PART A (12-15 lines):
```markdown
## STAGE 5: SCOPE BOUNDARIES & LEARNING OBJECTIVES

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Nature:** Clarification dialogue + synthesis  
**Purpose:** Finalize scope and synthesize learning objectives

---

### Context

Stage 5 is the synthesis stage that integrates ALL previous work into validated learning 
objectives. This stage has two parts:

**PART A: Scope Boundaries** - Clarifies what's IN/OUT of assessment scope based on 
Stages 0-2 content architecture and emphasis patterns.

**PART B: Learning Objectives Synthesis** - Creates learning objectives by integrating:
- Stage 0: Content architecture (Tiers 1-4)
- Stage 1: Validated priority structure
- Stage 2: Emphasis rationale and assessment focus
- Stage 3: Instructional examples
- Stage 4: Common misconceptions

This is the final BB1 stage - outputs become the foundation for BB2 (Assessment Design).

```

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Lines to add:** ~15 lines

---

### Gap 2: No Guidance on Objectives Count

**Current State:**
- Integration Logic says "2-4 objectives per major concept" for Tier 1
- Says "1-2 objectives per concept" for Tier 2
- BUT doesn't give total target or guidance on avoiding too many/too few

**Recommendation:**
ADD "Objective Count Guidelines" section in PART B after Integration Logic (8-10 lines):
```markdown
### Objective Count Guidelines

**Target Ranges:**
- Total objectives: 15-30 (depending on course scope)
- Tier 1: 10-20 objectives (majority of assessment)
- Tier 2: 3-8 objectives (supplementary assessment)
- Tier 3: 0-2 objectives (background, if included)

**Quality over Quantity:**
- Better to have 15 well-crafted objectives than 40 vague ones
- Each objective should be specific, measurable, and evidence-based
- Combine related learning goals rather than splitting unnecessarily

**Red Flags:**
- <10 total objectives: Probably too few, missing important learning goals
- >40 total objectives: Too many, likely splitting hairs or including background content
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Lines to add:** ~10 lines

---

### Gap 3: Documentation Location for Outputs

**Current State:**
- Final Output Format shows the structure
- Supporting Documentation lists what's included
- BUT doesn't specify WHERE final outputs are saved

**Recommendation:**
ADD to Supporting Documentation section (4-5 lines):
```markdown
## SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION

**Where Documents Are Saved:**
All BB1 outputs are saved in the BB1 output package directory:
- Validated Learning Objectives (this document)
- Content Analysis (from Stage 0)
- Example Catalog (from Stage 3)
- Misconception Registry (from Stage 4)

This Learning Objectives document is accompanied by:
[existing content...]
```

**Priority:** LOW  
**Lines to add:** ~5 lines

---

### Gap 4: Validation Dialogue Strategy Missing

**Current State:**
- Validation Dialogue section shows:
  - Presenting approach
  - Common Issues & Solutions
  - Refinement Process
- BUT doesn't give systematic strategy for presenting ALL objectives

**Recommendation:**
ADD "Systematic Presentation Strategy" before "Presenting" in Validation Dialogue (8-10 lines):
```markdown
#### Systematic Presentation Strategy

**How to Present Objectives:**
1. **Present by topic** (not by Bloom's level) - keeps context clear
2. **Show all objectives for a topic together** - teacher sees complete picture
3. **Highlight evidence and examples** for each objective
4. **After each topic, pause for feedback** before moving to next
5. **Take notes on requested changes** but don't interrupt flow
6. **After all topics presented, go back and make revisions**

This prevents fragmentation and allows teacher to see the complete learning story for 
each topic before commenting.
```

**Priority:** LOW TO MEDIUM  
**Lines to add:** ~10 lines

---

### Gap 5: No Bloom's Level Decision Guide for Edge Cases

**Current State:**
- Bloom's Taxonomy Application shows verbs for each level
- FOR TEACHERS section says "Claude will suggest the correct level"
- BUT no guidance for Claude on distinguishing between levels when ambiguous

**Recommendation:**
ADD "Bloom's Level Decision Guide" after Bloom's Taxonomy Application (12-15 lines):
```markdown
### Bloom's Level Decision Guide

**When uncertain between levels:**

**Remember vs. Understand:**
- Remember: Can they recall/recognize without explanation? → Remember
- Understand: Must they explain WHY or HOW? → Understand

**Understand vs. Apply:**
- Understand: Explaining a concept in their own words → Understand
- Apply: Using the concept in a NEW scenario → Apply

**Apply vs. Analyze:**
- Apply: Using a procedure/method in a situation → Apply
- Analyze: Breaking down relationships, comparing/contrasting → Analyze

**Analyze vs. Evaluate:**
- Analyze: Examining components and relationships → Analyze
- Evaluate: Making judgments with justification → Evaluate

**Default to lower level when uncertain** - easier to assess validly.
```

**Priority:** LOW TO MEDIUM  
**Lines to add:** ~15 lines
