# BB2 SESSION - QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE

**What was accomplished:** 4 new stage files created (1,071 lines)  
**What needs manual work:** Stage gates + navigation additions  
**Time to operational:** 15-20 minutes of manual edits

---

## WHAT TO DO NOW

### STEP 1: Check if bb2h exists (1 minute)
```
/Users/niklaskarlsson/AIED_EdTech_Dev_documentation_projects/Modular QGen - Modular Question Generation Framework/docs/MQG_0.2/MQG_bb2h_Stage7_Blueprint_Construction.md
```
- **If YES:** Great! Skip to Step 2
- **If NO:** The 573-line content is in this conversation - scroll up or I can provide it

### STEP 2: Add stage gates (5 minutes) ⚠️ URGENT
Open: `BB2_MANUAL_STAGE_GATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` 

This file tells you exactly:
- Which files to edit (bb2b and bb2c)
- What text to find
- What to paste
- Why it's critical

### STEP 3: Add navigation to bb2a (5 minutes)
Open: `bb2a_navigation_addition.txt`

Paste this section into bb2a after "Process Overview: Seven Connected Stages"

### STEP 4: Test with Claude
Upload all BB2 files to a Claude conversation and verify:
- Stage gates prevent auto-advancement
- Teacher approval required at each stage
- No improvisation

## WHAT HAPPENS AFTER MANUAL EDITS

Once you complete the 3 manual steps (15-20 min):

**BB2 Status:**
- All 8-9 files exist ✅
- All stage files have gates ✅
- bb2a has navigation ✅
- Framework operational ✅

**Next Development Phase (future session):**
- Comprehensive overlap analysis (like BB1)
- Create BB2_COMPLETE_FINAL_SUMMARY.md
- Optional: bb2i facilitation guide

**Estimated remaining:** 3 hours to 100% feature complete

## IF YOU GET STUCK

**Problem:** Can't find a file mentioned  
**Solution:** All manual instruction content is in the outputs directory

**Problem:** Stage gate text doesn't match  
**Solution:** Look for similar text near end of file, adjust as needed

**Problem:** bb2h doesn't exist  
**Solution:** Scroll up in this conversation - the full 573-line content is there

**Problem:** Want to verify files were created  
**Solution:** Check `/Users/niklaskarlsson/.../MQG_0.2/` for MQG_bb2d through MQG_bb2g

## SUCCESS METRICS

After manual edits complete, you should have:

✅ 8-9 modular BB2 files  
✅ All files with proper stage gates  
✅ bb2a with navigation guide  
✅ Consistent structure across all files  
✅ No risk of Claude improvisation  
✅ Ready for actual use with students

**Current Progress:** 85-90% complete  
**Manual Work Required:** 15-20 minutes
