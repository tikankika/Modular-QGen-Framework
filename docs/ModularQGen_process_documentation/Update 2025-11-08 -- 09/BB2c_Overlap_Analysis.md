**Analysis Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Total Lines:** 178

## OVERLAPS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Formative vs. Summative Framework (APPROPRIATE DETAIL EXPANSION)

**Location in bb2c:** Lines 37-109 (Complete framework with prototypes)
- Detailed operational framework for teachers
- Specific characteristics for each type
- When appropriate guidance
- Hybrid approach options
- Comprehensive decision-making tool

**Overlap with bb2a:** Lines 101-132 (Theoretical foundation)
- Black & Wiliam's (1998) research basis
- Conceptual distinction
- Design implications overview
- Theoretical grounding

**Type:** Theory (bb2a) vs. Practice (bb2c) - Appropriate separation

**Severity:** ZERO - Intentional complementary design

**Recommendation:** KEEP BOTH
- bb2a: Provides research foundation and theoretical grounding
- bb2c: Provides operational decision framework for teachers
- bb2a already includes cross-reference to bb2c (added in revision)
- Perfect modular design

---

### 2. Assessment Purpose Cascade Effects (REFERENCE VS. DETAIL)

**Location in bb2c:** Lines 30-35 (Brief mention of cascade)
- "Assessment strategy decisions cascade through remaining design stages"
- Lists affected dimensions

**Also mentioned in bb2a:** Lines 129-132
- "This decision cascades through subsequent choices"
- Similar concept

**Type:** Concept reinforcement - Not duplication

**Severity:** VERY LOW - Brief mentions in both for context

**Recommendation:** KEEP BOTH
- Important concept worth mentioning in multiple places
- bb2c provides more operational detail about what cascades
- Not extensive enough to be problematic duplication

---

### 3. Practical Constraints Framework (UNIQUE TO BB2c)

**Location in bb2c:** Lines 111-152 (Comprehensive constraints documentation)
- Time Available
- Student Preparation Level
- Platform Capabilities
- Grading Resources
- Student Population Size

**Checked against:** All other bb2 files

**Type:** Unique Stage 2 content

**Severity:** ZERO - No overlap

**Recommendation:** KEEP - Essential Stage 2 content

---

### 4. Stage Checkpoint Format (INTENTIONAL REPETITION)

**Location in bb2c:** Lines 154-178 (Stage 2 Checkpoint + Completion)

**Present in:** All stage files (bb2b-bb2h)

**Type:** Safety mechanism - Intentional repetition

**Severity:** ZERO - Deliberate and necessary

**Recommendation:** KEEP ALL
- Stage gates must be explicit in every stage file
- Prevents improvisation
- Critical framework integrity mechanism

---

### 5. Configuration Defaults Concept (UNIQUE TO BB2c)

**Location in bb2c:** Lines 161-166 (Configuration defaults based on purpose)
- Feedback timing
- Attempt policy
- Difficulty emphasis
- Point approach

**Checked against:** Other stage files

**Type:** Stage 2 specific output

**Severity:** ZERO - No overlap

**Recommendation:** KEEP - Essential Stage 2 deliverable

---

## OVERLAPS WITH OTHER STAGE FILES

### 6. Stage 3, 4, 5, 6 Reference (APPROPRIATE FORWARD REFERENCE)

**Location in bb2c:** Lines 166-168 (What Stage 2 decisions will guide)
- Mentions that strategy guides question count, distributions, etc.

**Type:** Forward reference to upcoming stages

**Severity:** ZERO - Appropriate navigation aid

**Recommendation:** KEEP - Helps users understand process flow

---

## OVERLAPS WITH BB2i (FACILITATION)

### 7. Formative vs. Summative Discussion Pattern (NO DUPLICATION)

**bb2c contains:** Operational framework for teachers to make decisions
**bb2i contains:** Meta-guidance on how AI should facilitate the discussion

**Type:** Different levels of abstraction (what vs. how)

**Severity:** ZERO - No overlap

**Recommendation:** KEEP BOTH
- bb2c: What the framework contains
- bb2i: How to facilitate discussion about it

---

## CONTENT GAPS IN BB2c

### Gap 1: No Prerequisites Note (OPTIONAL)

**Issue:** Like bb2b before revision, bb2c jumps straight into content

**Impact:** Minor - users following sequential flow have context

**Recommendation:** ADD optional prerequisites note (VERY LOW priority):
```markdown
**Prerequisites:** Review of assessment purpose distinctions in bb2a 
(Theoretical Foundations) recommended before this stage.
```

---

### Gap 2: No Explicit Reference to bb2a Cross-Reference (ALREADY RESOLVED)

**Issue:** bb2c doesn't know that bb2a now points to it

**Impact:** None - bb2a already has the reference pointing TO bb2c

**Status:** ✅ ALREADY HANDLED in bb2a revision

**Recommendation:** No action needed in bb2c

---

### Gap 3: Hybrid Assessment Could Use More Examples (OPTIONAL)

**Issue:** Lines 97-109 mention hybrid approaches but are brief

**Impact:** Very minor - concept is clear

**Recommendation:** OPTIONAL enhancement (VERY LOW priority):
- Could add 1-2 specific hybrid examples
- Not necessary - current explanation is adequate

---

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

### Overlap Severity: ZERO TO VERY LOW

**Total Overlaps Identified:** 7 instances examined

**Critical Overlaps:** 0 (none requiring removal)

**Moderate Overlaps:** 0 (none requiring significant revision)

**Low-Severity Overlaps:** 1 (cascade effects briefly mentioned in both bb2a and bb2c)
- Severity: VERY LOW - brief reinforcement, not extensive duplication

**Appropriate Overlaps/References:** 6 (all serving correct purposes)

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### For bb2c (1 optional enhancement):

1. **Add prerequisites note** (VERY LOW priority - optional):
   ```markdown
   **Prerequisites:** Review of assessment purpose distinctions in bb2a 
   (Theoretical Foundations: Formative and Summative Assessment Functions) 
   recommended for context before this stage.
   ```
   **Location:** After header, before "STAGE 2: ASSESSMENT STRATEGY DEFINITION"

**Total Changes:** 1 optional small addition, 0 removals, ~3 lines

---

## ASSESSMENT

**Overall bb2c Quality:** EXCELLENT

**Structural Integrity:** ✅ Perfect stage-specific design

**Content Uniqueness:** ✅ All core content unique to Stage 2

**Overlap Issues:** ✅ ZERO problematic overlaps

**Practical Utility:** ✅ Comprehensive operational framework

**Complementary Design:** ✅ Perfect complement to bb2a theoretical foundation

---

## DETAILED EVALUATION

### Formative vs. Summative Framework Quality ✅

**bb2c framework is excellent because:**
- Presents as continuum, not binary choice
- Clear prototypes at each end
- Acknowledges hybrid possibilities
- "When appropriate" guidance for each type
- Specific feature lists for teachers
- Practical decision support

**Relationship with bb2a:**
- bb2a provides WHY (research basis, theory)
- bb2c provides WHAT (operational framework)
- bb2a points users to bb2c for operational detail
- Perfect separation of concerns

### Practical Constraints Documentation ✅

**Comprehensive and actionable:**
- Five clear constraint categories
- Each explained with implications
- Documentation format provided
- Connects constraints to future design decisions
- Helps teachers think through feasibility upfront

### Stage 2 Output Quality ✅

**Clear deliverables:**
- Assessment type decision
- Configuration defaults documented
- Constraints explicitly recorded
- Foundation for remaining stages established

---

## CONCLUSION

BB2c (Stage 2: Assessment Strategy Definition) is excellently designed with ZERO overlap concerns. The formative/summative framework complements (not duplicates) bb2a's theoretical foundation perfectly. All stage-specific content is unique and valuable.

**Main Action:**
1. Optional: Add prerequisites note (VERY LOW priority)

**Priority:** VERY LOW - bb2c functions excellently as-is

The one brief mention of "cascade effects" in both bb2a and bb2c is appropriate reinforcement, not problematic duplication.

**Analysis Complete:** bb2c overlap analysis  
**Status:** ✅ ZERO OVERLAP ISSUES  
**Recommended Revisions:** 1 optional enhancement  
**Priority:** VERY LOW (optional only, no problems found)
